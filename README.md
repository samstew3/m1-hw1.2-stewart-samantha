## About Me
Hi, my name is Samantha and I was born and raised in Tampa, FL. I've lived here my whole life and love my city! My favorite things to do are hangout with my family and friends, go on the boat, and travel when I can. I graduated from University of Florida with a business marketing degree, worked for a few months at a design build firm, and am now back in school to learn about web design and adobe software.
## Past Coding Experience
I have zero coding experience so I am very excited to be in this course and learn more about it. I feel like I have learned a new language just getting to this point so I can't wait to see what else I will learn in the next few months!
## Career Goals
1. Work in a career that betters the lives of others 
2. Do graphic design for a school, church or non profit that I am passionate about, and for a nutritionist
3. Work on the design layout for a cookbook 
4. Complete an interior decorating project 
5. Give back and help others acheive their goals
